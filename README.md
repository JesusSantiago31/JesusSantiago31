## Welcome to my Profile !!
## I am Jesus SSC
* This is my GitHub profile where I upload all the knowledge I'm acquiring at the Tecnol√≥gico de Estudios Superiores de Jilotepec, and on my own.
* I'm currently interested in learning new programming languages, to be a great developer, having different alternatives and analyzing in certain specific circumstances the best programming language to achieve an efficient program.
* I will be updating all the programs that I will be coding, from some courses that I find interesting or activities that I do at school.
